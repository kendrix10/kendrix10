## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my coding and analytics playground. This is a space where I am free to explore the depths of my current skillset and exchange ideas with remarkable people in this space. It is a place of continuous growth and development where we can experiment on techniques and try out different ideas for any projects, developments and challenges for work, school or daily life. 

In 2025, here is a snippet of what I am currently working, what I have learned and what I hope to accomplish. Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub. 

**ðŸ¤” Currently working on**: Various scRNAseq projects to uncover cell-type specific targets for biomarker discovery

**ðŸŒ± What I've learned**: ML predictive classifier on Python

**ðŸ”­ Hope to accomplish**: Develop a preprocessing pipeline to understand and analyse spatial transcriptomics data
